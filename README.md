# Machine_learning_assignment2
In this project, I aim to design and implement a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline, focusing on addressing common challenges in real-world datasets. These challenges include missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise, all of which can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models. By performing effective preprocessing, this project seeks to improve the data's quality, reliability, and overall usefulness, ensuring it is ready for accurate analysis and model building.

The dataset provided is first explored to understand its structure, unique values in each feature, and key statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This initial exploration helps identify potential issues such as missing or inconsistent data. In the cleaning phase, we treat missing values by replacing them with appropriate measures like mean, median, or mode. We also address outliers and remove any duplicate rows to ensure the dataset is clean and free from inconsistencies.

Further analysis is performed to filter data based on specific conditions, such as age and salary, and to visualize key relationships between features. This includes generating scatter plots to examine correlations and bar charts to visualize categorical data, like the distribution of individuals from different places.

To prepare the dataset for machine learning models, categorical variables are encoded into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding. Finally, feature scaling is applied using both standard scaling and Min-Max scaling to ensure that the data is normalized and suitable for model training, avoiding any bias due to differing scales of features.

This systematic approach ensures the dataset is properly preprocessed, enabling efficient and reliable machine learning analysis while maintaining the integrity and usefulness of the data.
